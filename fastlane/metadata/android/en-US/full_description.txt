one-stop app for live concert bootlegs! Curated from the vast archives of the Internet Archive,
Gizz Tapes lets you relive the band's legendary performances at the click of a button.

What is Gizz Tapes?
Gizz Tapes is a jukebox for live recordings of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard shows. It’s a
strictly unofficial app with no ties to the band, designed for fans by fans. All audio is hosted
and streamed directly from the Internet Archive, while artwork, show notes, and metadata are
sourced from KGLW.net. Inspired by platforms like phish.in and Relisten, Gizz Tapes brings
together audio from both the Live Music Archive and Community Audio collections, offering a
seamless listening experience.
