**Gizz Tapes** is your ultimate jukebox for live tapes of [King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/) shows!
This **unofficial** app has no affiliation with the band but is built with love for the community.
It utilizes the [Gizz Tapes Api](https://tapes.kglw.net/api/docs/) to bring you a treasure trove of live recordings.
All audio is hosted by and streamed from the Internet Archive. Artwork, show notes and other metadata are obtained from [KGLW.net](http://kglw.net).
